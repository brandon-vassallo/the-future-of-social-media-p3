    <p>  To anyone who recognizes the name â€œ4chanâ€, very little positivity comes to mind. The forum-based website may seem innocent in theory, but is home to many radical politics and destructive communities - such as their very strong alt-right white supremacist community. Their most notable effort was in their work in overpopulating the Pepe meme during the 2016 election. In the years leading up to the election, a meme called Pepe was circulating around the internet, used for relatable moments and punchlines to light-hearted jokes. However, as the years rolled on, the meme was soon used frequently by people on 4chan by people of the alt right, associating the image with offensive content and using a veil of comedy to defend themselves from criticism. For the upcoming election, 4chans alt-right community then decided to use Pepe to get Donald Trump elected as president by flooding the internet with Pepeâ€™s that were drawn to look like Donald Trump and associating with his politics - eventually catching the attention of Trump himself. Hillary Clinton criticized the meme for being rooted in racism and misogyny, but all that did was backlash onto her due to coming off as having a lack of understanding for the youth. The rest is history, Donald Trump became president in 2016, and while there was certainly a genuine support base for Donald Trump, you can't deny the influence this tactic had on the election. With social media open to so many people of so many belief systems, people who were part of such hateful organizations not only had a free space to fester their hatred, but had the ability to elaborately infiltrate pop culture and warp the fate of an entire nation. </p>

<p>  With social media open to so many people of so many belief systems, people who were part of such hateful organizations not only had a free space to fester their hatred, but had the ability to elaborately infiltrate pop culture and warp the fate of an entire nation. While the positive side of politics on the internet (in theory) is that people can be in constant engagement with eachother of alternate viewpoints, the negative side is that they can also fester into hidden corners of which they can feel empowered. In order to combat something like this, people should be more aware of other political opinions in order to change ones mind. In the case of online inteaction, I belive the integration of different political viewpoints should be encouraged on websites like this. But even then, those who are determined to form hate groups can make their own websites if they want. The best thing to do is have an awareness of these groups, and in a worse case scenario, resort to activism to fight it. </p>
